/**
 * Represents all possible responses that the Chatbot can have. There must be at least
 * one reponse per {@link DialoguePath} enum.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code DialogueMap} enum is used by the {@link Chatbot} to determine what the response
 * should be based on the given DiloguePath enum.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A special feature that DialogueMap has is a substitution system similar to that of Format
 * Strings in Python. The rules are as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Substitution is detected by curly braces, and the content within the curly braces
 *     determines what needs to be substituted into the String</li>
 *     <li>The list of possible substitutions are as follows:
 *         <ol>
 *             <li>{name} -> the name of the Chatbot</li>
 *             <li>{r:\a} -> where \a is an integer. r indicates the use of the additional results appended to
 *             the {@link com.neokortex.commands.Response} class. the integer a refers to
 *             the index of the additional results to use.</li>
 *         </ol>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
